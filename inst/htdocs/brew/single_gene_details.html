Interested in a single gene ? You can retrieve the available differential expression scores for a gene symbol, Entrez identifier or microarray probe by pasting it into the text field below.<br>
gCMAPWeb will not calculate any new statistic, but simply return the information available in its reference datasets.<br>
Please note that some datasets may not contain data for your gene of interest, e.g. if it was not represented on the microarray platform or was not included in the annotation database used to assign RNAseq counts to genes.
