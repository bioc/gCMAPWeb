<p class="lead">Do you query genes significantly overlap a reference gene set ?</p>
To run a non-directional query, simply provide symbol, Entrez or array-specific gene identifiers. gCMAPWeb will identify significantly up- or down-regulated genes for each experiment in the reference database and use Fisher's exact test (Fisher, J R Stat Soc, 1922) to identify significant overlap with your genes of interest.<br>
<br>Choose this option e.g. for
<ul>
<li>gene sets constituting a pathway with both up- and down-regulated genes</li>
<li>targets of a transcription factor that can act both as a repressor and activator</li>
</ul>
Please note: if you have information about the direction of gene regulation, e.g. which genes are expected to be up- or down-regulated, consider using gCMAPWeb's <a href="signed_input.rhtml">directional query</a> instead.
